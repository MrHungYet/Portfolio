## 1.Project Background

In the cutthroat world of e-commerce, refining marketing strategies and improving customer experience are vital to long-term success.

The project uses the [E-Commerce Sales Data from Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data/data).

## 2. Goals

a. Segment customers into 5 levels: VIP, Loyal, Potential, At risk, Lost.

b. Propose marketing campaigns for each group.

c. Measure performance.

## 3. Result

 We categorized over 4,000 customers into 5 distinct value groups, making it way easier to tailor our marketing strategies.

 The real game-changer? We found that just 29% of our customers (the VIP group) drive a whopping 77% of our revenue—helping us cut wasted spend and reallocate 35% of our marketing budget more effectively.

 And here’s a big opportunity: By launching a “We Miss You” email campaign targeting the At Risk group, we could boost revenue by up to 30%. Pretty cool, right?
